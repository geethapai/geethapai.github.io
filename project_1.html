					<h2>Mobile Banking Application</h2>
					<p>A major regional bank asked Fresh Tilled Soil for its UX thinking, strategy and UI design with their new mobile banking app. I worked with several designers on various components of this project, including the app’s information architecture, user flows and user interface.</p>
					
					<h3>Problem</h3>
					<p>This project was unique in that the client was working with outside developers who had created initial screenshots of various screens. However, the client asked us to step in and redo the overall user experience and information architecture (IA).</p> 
				</div><!-- project-text -->	
				

				<div class="project-text row">
					<h3>Process</h3>
					<p><span class="bold">Information Architecture:</span> Our first step was to get together and make sense of the client’s requirements. We got together in a room and pulled apart the major features of the application based on the initial screenshots we were given. However, since the initial screens were not based on a coherent structure for the whole app, we realized we needed to take a step back and just look at the central actions a user would need to do while using the app.</p> 
					
					<p>On the whiteboard, we created a high-level map of those actions, just touching on the major components of the app (not pictured here).  Those major actions centered around Accounts, Bill Pay, Deposits and Transfers – the central components of the IA. Once we outlined those 4 key sections, we pulled apart the Bill Pay section. We thought about how a user would approach this section and what they would want to accomplish. The client’s requirements listed different types of payments as options within the navigation depending on the type of payee - such as internal and external payments (which most of us were unclear about!) Most users likely don’t think there’s a difference in these sorts of payments – they just want to pay a bill, so we used "Pay a Bill" as a top level choice within Bill Pay. After thinking through all the actions within this section and organizing them in a straightforward way, the top-level tasks became pay a bill, view past/pending payments, manage payees and set reminders. The IA maps for the overall app and the Bill Pay section served as a way to have a discussion between the client and us about the high-level architecture.</p>

					<figcaption>Sketches of screens in the Accounts section</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<div class="project-text row">
				<p><span class="bold">Accounts:</span> In addition to working on flows for the login process and selecting multiple usernames, I worked with another designer to create both the flows and high-fidelity mockups for the Accounts section. Again, the client gave us requirements for this section in terms of what should appear on the screen, but it was up to us to develop the flow and screens. We needed to give user the ability to see all their accounts and then choose one account to dive into more detail. Within the account, users would be able to see all transactions pertaining to that account and search transactions within that account. First we sketched a user flow of what a person could do from each section of the accounts section (see first image). Then we sketched out screens of how someone would pick an account, view more transaction details and search their previous transactions (see second image). The sketching process helped us clarify and flesh out the various actions available on each screen. In fact, as we started sketching screens we would become aware of additional user actions, and have to go back and edit our flow chart. The final version is pictured on the top of this page.</p>

				<p>For this particular project, we treated the sketches as wireframes and then dove into visual design.  A mobile style guide was developed that included different UI elements, colors etc.  (Please note: the UI screens on this page have been stripped of color and other unique details to protect client identity).</p>

				</figure>

					<h3>Result</h3>
					<p>The IA mapping and initial UI development have served as good discussion points to validate our thinking around the user experience, information architecture and visual design. While the project continues to be ongoing, the client has approved our UX strategy thus far. The app will be released later this year.</p>
