      <p><a href="https://www.polleverywhere.com" class="para-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poll Everywhere</a></span> a profitable Y-Combinator startup, is a SaaS company that offers <span class="bold">offers a live audience engagement tool that allows presenters to connect with their audience via polls, Q&A‚Äôs and other types of activities sharing live results immediately.</span>¬†A core part of the functionality are a controls that span across 2 screen that allows presenters to manage their polls and presentation.¬†They can lock a poll so it no longer registers responses, navigate to other polls within a group and reset a poll by clearing all received responses. Importantly, presenters also use the controls to switch between different views of a poll. For example, they can choose when to simply show the poll question or show responses to the poll or even show correct answers if applicable.</p>

      <p>This project involved redesigning and shipping Poll Everywhere‚Äôs the controls and feature layout across 2 connected screens.</p>

    <div class="subsection-text cell small-12 medium-7 large-7">
    <h2 class="headline">Large controls block the live results chart</h2>
      <p>Based on years of customer conversations, we knew that our presentation controls were a problem. They were so large that they <span class="bold">covered the live results chart - THE product - the core reason why customers use Poll Everywhere</span>. When a presenter clicks on a slide to display the controls, they‚Äôre viewable by everyone who is participating. Covering the chart was not only an issue because it hindered people‚Äôs ability to clearly see live results, but also because it was our billboard - the feature that peaks audience members interest to look into our product when they see it being used.</p>

      <p>Some items on the controls were confusing too. Customers would have questions like these:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What‚Äôs fullscreen mode? Why is there an activate button when my activity is in fullscreen - I thought it was already "enabled and active" during fullscreen mode?</li>
        <li>Why for instance does the ‚ÄúClear responses‚Äù button use a file box icon? Does that mean responses are stored away after they‚Äôre removed from the screen? Or are they deleted completely?</li>

  <div class="subsection-text cell small-12 medium-7 large-7">
    <h2 class="headline">Redesigning 2 connected ‚Äúbread and butter‚Äù screens</h2>
  <p>The presentation controls probably should be called ‚Äúactivity controls‚Äù because they are used across 2 connected screens:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><span class="bold">the activity page</span> - where presenters make adjustments to their activity, like adjusting a response timer or the visual style of their activity</li>
      <li><span class="bold">presentation mode</span> - the live chart that presenters display to their audience.</li>
    </ol>

  <p>Essentially, the activity page is the <span class="bold">‚Äúoff-stage‚Äù</span> portion before a presentation and presentation mode is <span class="bold">‚Äúon-stage‚Äù</span> when a presenter is showing the activity to their audience.</p>
  <p>I call these 2 screens the ‚Äúbread and butter‚Äù of Poll Everywhere‚Äôs product. The activity screen is where all the set-up parameters happen to create the magic on the live results screen. The live chart interaction is the product that customers sign up to use. (presentation mode).</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Important note:</span> the creation of an activity does not happen on the activity page. The activity page displays the activity once a user creates their question.</p>

  <p>Since the controls cut across 2 screens, this project would involve redesigning parts of both the activity screen and the presentation screen.</p>
  <p>Despite the desire to improve the user experience and make both pages more modern, several core portions were <span class="bold"></span>off-the-table:</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="bold">The live results chart:</span> this would be an enormous technical undertaking and we didn‚Äôt have the internal staffing because engineers were need on other projects.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">The visual settings panel</span> on the activity page: another massive technical challenge and we didn‚Äôt have the bandwidth for this either.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">The configuration panel on the activity page</span>, a big technical rats‚Äô nest (yes üò¨) would get descoped from the project after I started the design phase of this project. Designers usually start several weeks ahead of the engineers and then start overlapping before an agile 6-week sprint, so we lost no time with my config panel layout designs (which you‚Äôll see later).</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Due to these off-the-table sections, my key user stories ended up being the ones in the image below.</p>

      <p>While I briefly looked at several products in the same product space, those did not end up being helpful because our product mental models were a little different. It was more fruitful to look at <span class="bold">products like slideware that had a live presentation moment with an  ‚Äúoff-stage‚Äù experience and ‚Äúon-stage‚Äù experience - or live video conferencing software that had a set of controls for quick ease of use during a meeting or presentation.</span></p>

      <p>I was researching these tools to see how they organized their layout and controls in a way that had great usability and were also fresh and streamlined.</p>

      <p>As you‚Äôll see in the design iteration many of the patterns from these products, like tool and controls organization influenced some of my design choices.</p>

      <h2 class="headline">Breadcrumb nav is optimal, but we need an interim solution</h2>

    <p>During the activity page and presentation controls project, I collaborated with a design colleague to create a folder system to help presenters organize all there activity questions. Breadcrumb navigation paired with folder management allowed presenters to navigate into a folder, select an activity and view it on the activity page, with the folder name listed in a breadcrumb on a bar at the top of the screen. This tested well and would serve as a good pattern for single-focused tasks across Poll Everywhere, like our reports feature.</p>

    <p><span class="bold">The problem:</span> The <span class="bold">new folders feature, which was a huge amount of technical challenge, had only just begun. (It would also take a year to finish). So I couldn‚Äôt use the breadcrumb topbar pattern just yet.</span> The other issue: our product nav was also horizontal bar on the top of the screen and my PM colleague had data that our customers would sometimes navigate away from the activity page to parts of the product. The single-focused task idea wouldn‚Äôt quite work yet unless we also had a way to still show parts of the product‚Äôs navigation. We ended up rebuilding the nav to a vertical navigation several months later and were able to incorporate the breadcrumb topbar. (See end case study).</p>

    <p><span class="bold">Interim solution:</span> As part of our design system, we also designed new pattern of toolbars to house primary, secondary and tertiary actions.  I tried these patterns out for the activity page, and ran this CTA pattern through many clickthrough tests on Usability Hub, which tests successfully. More on the actual CTAs in the next section below.</p>

    <div class="subsection-text cell small-12 medium-7 large-7"><h2 class="headline">Roadblock: Shipping behind a feature flag</h2>
    <p>We shipped the controls for the activity page and presentation screen, as well as the updated activity page layout behind a flag. It so happened that we had 2 other major product changes coming - the folder system and new vertical navigation pattern. <span class="bold">Our Head of Product was concerned to throw these new massive feature overhauls at customers in quick succession, so while our project shipped - it shipped behind a feature flag.</span> A very small cohort of new customers saw the new UI, but we did not get any meaningful or helpful data to support any additional changes.</p>

    <p>Shipping behind a flag ended up being a boon.</span></p>

    <p>Luckily the topbar breadcrumb pattern finally got implemented via our new vertical navigation project. I did not work on implementation because I was working on completing major work on the folders project. The breadcrumb topbar created more room for our primary, tertiary and secondary buttons - Present, Activate and Share, an idea I explored in my initial design explorations. Visual settings also got a spot on the topbar where it tested well. The button pattern followed our new design system primary, secondary, tertiary pattern.</p>
