            <p>Geetha brings a unique background in psychology, research and education to her design work. Before her design career, she created and deployed large-scale community development initiatives, where she learned to pilot and create solutions based on user and community needs.</p> 

            <p>At Poll Everywhere, Geetha helped to restructure the company’s main product offering and design new core features. She worked closely with her design and engineering colleagues to systemize new components and UI patterns within a new design system. She also worked alongside the Director of Product to conceptualize and identify new product improvements and features. Finally, Geetha spearheaded design at the company, collaborating with product and engineering colleagues to ensure alignment on core design-related decisions.</p>

            <p>At Favorite Medium, a global design and technology firm with offices in the San Francisco Bay Area, Singapore, Seoul, and Tokyo, Geetha worked on a wide-range of products, including mobile software connected to cutting-edge IoT devices, enterprise applications and consumer-facing MVP products. Since Favorite Medium specializes in both design and development, Geetha worked on end-to-end design-to-production solutions. Work included digital products for Abbott Diabetes Care, Steelcase, Los Angeles CleanTech Incubator and a host of other companies.</p>

            <p>Endlessly inquisitive, Geetha soaks up knowledge and information from a variety of fields including urban planning, food culture, graphic design, literature, contemplative practices and, of course, product design. Noticing this thirst for knowledge, Favorite Medium put Geetha in charge of “FM Made This”, a monthly session that allows designers and developers to share how they built a product and solved a problem for a client.

            <p>During her design career, Geetha has helped companies shape the strategic direction of products, including MVP feature prioritization and roadmaps. She has a holistic process that involves research to understand user needs to garner key product-related insights, designing wireframes and prototypes, establishing a product’s information architecture, creating visual designs and validating design decisions through both concept testing and usability studies. Geetha also has experience running design sprints.</p> 

            <p>Her toolkit includes designing and conducting stakeholder and user interviews, running design workshops, setting up remote tests to validate information architecture and conducting task analyses, creating stimuli for concept testing and designing wireframes and high-fidelity visual designs for usability testing. Geetha also works closely with her product management and engineering colleagues to problem solve product issues, share design insights, write developer notes on validated visual designs, create and track tickets during the design handoff process and QA products during the coding/building process.</p>
