				<p><span>Hello!</span> My name is Geetha and I'm an aspiring product manager and front-end developer with a special interest in education and design. My background is in education and public policy. Most recently I worked for Harvard University on a number of projects, including a homework support program. Previously, I was Director, Community Impact at United Way of Massachusetts Bay and Merrimack Valley, where I designed, developed and managed several large-scale initiatives focused on early childhood development.
