            <p>Geetha brings to her UX work a unique background in psychology, research and education. Before her design career, she created and deployed large-scale community development initiatives, where she learned to pilot and create solutions based on user and community needs.</p> 

            <p>At Favorite Medium, a global design and technology firm with offices in the San Francisco Bay Area, Singapore, Seoul, and Tokyo, Geetha has  worked on a wide-range of products, including mobile software connected to cutting-edge IoT devices, enterprise applications and consumer-facing MVP products. Recent work includes digital products for Steelcase, Los Angeles CleanTech Incubator and Abbott Diabetes Care.</p>

            <p>Endlessly inquisitive, Geetha soaks up knowledge and information from a variety of fields including urban planning, food culture, graphic design, literature, contemplative practices and, of course, product design. Noticing this thirst for knowledge, Favorite Medium put Geetha in charge of “FM Made This”, a monthly session that allows designers and developers to share how they built a product and solved a problem for a client.
