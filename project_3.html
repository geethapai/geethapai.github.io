					<h2>User Testing a Textbook App</h2>
					<p>A major college textbook publisher tasked Fresh Tilled Soil with working on the conceptualization, UX and UI for a companion textbook app. The goal would be to enable students to read the same material in their physical textbook using the app, but also have access to additional study and comprehension features. Instructors would also be able to assign material through the application.</p>

					<h3>Process</h3>
					<p>Conceptualization, wireframing and high-fidelity prototypes were developed around one important feature of the product, which centered on saving important information to study later. We needed to see how students would respond to this component and if the initial prototypes were on the right path, so I joined some other designers on a trip to a local university to do some user testing. A couple scenarios were developed around using the app. Then we approached students and asked them for 15 minutes of their time (and offered them an Amazon gift card as an incentive). We presented them the high-fidelity prototype on an iPad using Invision App and oriented them to what they were seeing by setting some context. Then we asked them various questions, gave them various goals and tasks (“Can you tell me what you are seeing?”, “You have to study for a test – how would you save this content to study later?”, “How would highlight the text?” “How would you expect to find this information later?”).</p>


					<h3>Result</h3>
					<p>Most people understood the main feature, but the user testing provided us useful information about how to reframe some of the highlighting, studying and quizzing features. It was clear that the functionality of these special features were not obvious to many users. The testing information helped to refine those specific components and make the functionality more obvious to users. The updated functionality would be tested during another session with users. The project is ongoing and testing continues.</p>
