					<h3>Problem</h3>
					<p>A unique sports-related marketing agency needed a website redesign to showcase their services and amazing value-add. The company plays an integral role in some of the largest, most visibile sports events in the world, but this is not evident from looking at their site.  Their current site is dated and while they provide a variety of services it’s difficult to tell what their central role and value-add is for clients.</p>

					<h3>Role</h3>
					<p>My responsibilities were to develop an information architecture map of the company's current website, work with other designers to devise the new, simplified information architecture map based on user goals and design high-level conceptual wireframes based on initial stakeholder meetings.</p>

					<h3>Process</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>2 half day meetings with company stakeholders to understand companies mission and goals for redesign</li>
						<li>Empathy mapping to understand all the potential users' pain points and goals</li>
						<li>Mapped existing IA</li>
						<li>Developed new IA based on both business goals and main user goals</li>
						<li>Designed conceptual wireframes based on user goals to help clarify the company's value add</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Result</h3>
					<p>The client approved our high-level concepts and the project is still ongoing.</p>

							<h3>Proposed Information Architecture for Updated Site</h3>
							<p>Below is the redesigned IA architecture the company's central user goals and business needs. With the new IA, potential clients will have an easier time understand the company's services as well as their value-add. Users will also have an easier time finding information and learning about the company's past successes. (The IA maps have been altered to protect client identity.)</p>

			        <p>The wireframes below served as a way to show the clients some initial ideas following our Deep Dive meetings. My goal was ensure that the main services appeared on the home page, which the client wanted to highlight. The other component to highlight was both the call-to-action, as well as a persistent contact form. I also created a template to showcase client’s past work through case studies. (Wireframes have been altered to protect client identity.)</p>
