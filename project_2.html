					<h2>Conceptual Wireframes and IA</h2>
					<p>A unique sports-related marketing agency needed a website redesign to showcase their services and amazing value-add. Their current site is dated and while they provide a variety of services it’s difficult to tell what their central services are.</p>
					
					<h3>Process</h3>
					<p>Fresh Tilled Soil starts their engagement with clients through a Deep Dive, a design exercise which helps the agency and clients identify the customer experience from story arcs, customers’ touch points with the application or service overtime, personas and empathy mapping. Our first 2 meetings with the client helped to surface client's vision and some of the challenges they were facing. Their services are very unique and they have played a major role in some of the most high profile sporting events around the world. The problem is it is hard to know this by just looking at their currnet website. After the initial meetings, it was time for us create several artifacts to share with the client to showcase a potential scope of work.</p>

					<p>I was tasked with information architecture and initial conceptual wireframes. The client’s current website is a dated mess of pages. That's why they came to us for a redesign! My first step was to map out what the current information architecture looked like (see first image). Next, based on a working session I did with other designers, I fleshed out the proposed IA. Our meeting focused on doing some initial user flow mapping based on our understanding of their users and the persona empathy mapping we did with the clients. They are around 4 different groups of people they interface with and we needed to make sure they were addressed on the website. Our sketches focused on the main components identified during the client meeting. In particular it was important that potential customers would understand the clients’ value-add through case studies and also clearly understand the client’s business. The client provides multiple services and it was important to develop a coherent story that reflected these core services. That story would then inform the site architecture and the initial conceptual wireframes. Following the sketching session, I fleshed out both the existing and proposed IA.</p>

					<p>Next it was time to create wireframes. These wireframes were merely conceptual in nature and would serve as a way to show the clients some initial ideas following our Deep Dive meeting. I took guidance from our initial internal meeting around information architecture and fleshed out a couple pages. My goal was ensure that the main services appeared on the home page, which the client wanted to highlight. The other component to highlight was both the call-to-action, as well as a persistent contact form. I also created a template to showcase client’s past work through case studies. (Wireframes have been altered to protect client identity.) </p>

					<h3>Result</h3>
					<p>The client approved our high-level concepts and the project is still ongoing.</p>
