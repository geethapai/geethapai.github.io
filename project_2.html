        <p>I started iterating on wireframes based on the ideas I wanted to test out based on SaaS conversion research. <span class="bold">According to conversion research, anchoring the most expensive plan on the left along with “recommended” plan led to more conversions on higher priced plans.</span> I tried  anchoring out Enterprise plan on the left and emphasizing the plan benefits. <span class="bold">Each design tested a way to compare the same feature across different plans. All of the designs highlighted and anchored the recommended retail plan called Engage in the center.</span></p>  

        <p>I also experimented with <span class="bold">different ways to layout the larger feature comparison table, as well as an FAQ section which would answer customers’ most common sales questions upfront</span>.  Furthermore, each plan had text at the top describing how it would benefit a specific customer type. My marketing colleague solidified this targeted copy.</p>

          <div class="subsection-text cell small-12 medium-7 large-7"><h2 class="headline">Visual designs, preference and comprehension testing</h2>
          <p>Based on both the research I studied and conversations with internal stakeholders, <span class="bold">I narrowed down a set of 3 visual designs for preference and design comprehension tests</span>. The large gray feature comparison table and FAQ sections already had tested well and were finalized<span class="bold"> - so the top section with the plan columns was the primary focus of testing.</span></p>

          <p>The 3 designs were:</p>
        
          <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">“Everything Plus” Free-to-Expensive:</span> As you move rightwards towards higher priced plans, rather than repeating the same features from the previous plan, each plan column simply states “everything from the previous column - plus” that plan’s additional features. This design requires less back and forth effort when comparing columns.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">“Listed out” Free-to-Expensive:</span> This option repeats or lists out the same features between each plan column and moves from free to expensive from left to right.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">“Listed out” Expensive-to-Free:</span> In this design, the left-most column lists the most expensive  and then moves to lower prices plan towards the right. According the conversion research, this approach paired with a highlighted column is the most successful. However because it’s so unexpected, it’s the most controversial.</li>

    <div class="subsection-text cell small-12 medium-7 large-7"><h2 class="headline">Preference tests</h2>
    <p>In different Usability Hub tests I pitted each of the designs against each other in 1:1 comparisons including the old plans page. <span class="bold"> Testers overwhelmingly preferred the designs which showed plans with free on the left to the most expensive on the right versus the opposite.</span> There was a slight preference between “Everything Plus” Free-to-Expensive versus “Listed Out” Free-to-Expensive, though it was not statistically significant.  Testers preferred “Everything Plus” over the old plans page design. I also used Jeff Sauro’s research and tools on <a href="https://measuringu.com/preference-data/" class="para-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measuring U</a> to understand the data.</p>

    <div class="subsection-text cell small-12 medium-7 large-7"><h2 class="headline">Design comprehension tests</h2>
    <p>With the design comprehension test on Usability Hub, I presented a single design and then I asked tested various questions based on the design in front of them. For example: “Select all the plans that offer the Reporting feature.” or “Which plans allow audience members to respond to questions via the browser, SMS or the app?”. <span class ="bold">The goal with each of these questions was to see how easily users would be able to identify and compare features between columns in versions that list out the features or in ones that add features to each column moving to the right (“Everything Plus”).</span> All 3 designs plus the old plans page were tested.</p>
    <p><span class ="bold">Finally, I asked testers in every design test a scenario question that was meant to mimic the needs of an Enterprise customer.</span>Then I asked them which plan would best meet their needs. Tellingly, above 70% of testers chose “Enterprise” for every design except the old plans page. Only 30% of testers reviewing the old plans page could figure out that “Enterprise” was the right plan for their enterprise needs.</p>

    <p>I concurrently tested responsive designs for mobile size screens. Those tests were mainly focused on both comprehension and usability. For mobile, I landed on stacked plans columns and the FAQ section, but removed the feature comparison table as it was too much information to display on a small screen. This is a common practice for SaaS plan pages.</p>
    <p>The shipped mobile page can be viewed in the video below on or on <a href="https://www.polleverywhere.com/plans" class="para-link" target="_blank">Poll Everywhere’s plans page</a></span>.</p>

    <p>We initially planned to test several designs with A/B tests  separately over the course of a few months. Since all the 3 sets of designs faired decently well, my recommendation was to test all of them. However once we shipped the first design — “Everything Plus”, <span class ="bold">my product and marketing colleagues were so pleased with the results that they did not want to do additional tests with the other designs!<span></p>

    <p>With the “Everything Plus” design, <span class ="bold">payment conversions went up by 32% and product sign-ups increased by 62% for retail. The number of Enterprise leads also increased.</span></p>
