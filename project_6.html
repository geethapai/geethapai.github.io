					<h2>Food Waste App</h2>
					<p>To kick off my apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil, each of the 3 apprentices (including me) had to develop a highly-focused application with a single feature -  from UX strategy, to user research to code in just 2 weeks. We were told to focus more on how the prototype worked than how it looked. The challenge here would be to go from a broad set of problems to building a focused product.</p> 
					
					<h3>Problem</h3>
					<p>At the beginning I spent some time thinking about problems, I’d want to solve. I sketched a bunch of issues, but I kept coming back to one problem. A big challenge I face on a continual basis is throwing out food. I’ll go to the grocery store and purchase a bunch of produce, but sometimes it’s hard to finish and it goes to waste. I did some initial user research by just telling people about the idea. It turns out a lot of people I spoke to have the same issue. I validated my informal questions by also looking at statistics. On a population level, I already knew that food waste is a huge problem in the U.S. and other industrialized nations. Some countries, like the UK, even have formal food waste prevention programs to stem the tide of waste. I knew I was on to something.<p>

					<h3>Process</h3>
					<p><p><span class="bold">Initial Ideation:</span>Next, as I tried to figure out the focus of the app, I wanted to explore people who would potentially care about food waste. Some of these personas would likely be my target demographic. I came up with 4 basic assumptive personas. They were: 1) a person who is frugal and sees food waste as money going down the drain; 2) someone who feels guilty about throwing away food because other people are suffering from hunger 3) a person who sees throwing out food as a waste of resources that went into producing the food and 4) a person who loves cooking with interesting ingredients and feels bad he didn’t get to cook the purchased food. After coming up with the personas, I knew that the first 3 would be the most plausible users. However after this exercise, I realized I needed to step back again examine why people throw out food. Maybe that analysis would help me figure out how to focus the app.</p>

						<figcaption>Why Do People Throw Out Food?</figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					<p>The reasons why someone might throw out food is varied. Here are several reasons I learned about through my research: cooking more food than is actually needed, poor planning – like buying food and then going out to eat every night, confusion over food labeling and expiration dates, and storing food incorrectly. Would any of the problems be a compelling enough idea that I could develop a solution around? I knew it was time to do some user observations.</p>

					<p><span class="bold">User Research:</span>I wouldn’t be able to ask my friends if I could watch them throw out their food and question them about it! Announcing my motive would potentially alter how they behaved. My assumption was that people either throw out food right before they go to the grocery store or right after they return with their groceries. Therefore I asked a couple friends if I could come along during a visit to the grocery store and watch them store the food at home. My hope was that I would see them either throw out food before or after the shopping excursion. I would use that opportunity to ask them questions about why they were throwing out the food. Luckily, several friends humored me and my very strange request to accompany them! </p>

					<p>While the shopping excursion was fun, it didn’t turn out to be as fruitful as I hoped. Both couples just needed to make a smaller shopping trip because they were just picking up a few items due to upcoming vacation plans or the existing fresh food they already had. Neither threw out food before or after the trip. One couple did turn out to volunteer a lot of information about how they threw out food and how guilty they felt about it. This made me think it was time to dig deeper with a questionnaire.</p>

					<p>The questionnaire consisted of 5 questions and would only take 5-7 minutes to complete. Twenty of my friends did the survey and it yielded a lot of interesting results.</p>

					<p>The goal was to find out why people were throwing out food. To ground the questions in real world behavior, I asked them how much they threw out last week. Then I asked them why they threw out the food. I also asked them how the food got in a state that they would want to throw it out. Then I asked them to estimate how many they threw out for a specific reason. My initial assumption was that people would throw out food because they were unsure of expiration dates. There’s been a lot of research about how expiration dates are confusing, so I also wanted to find out why people were throwing out food related to expiration dates. Feel free to look at survey <a class="para-anchors" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/8ZT9KQQ">here</a>.</p>

					<p>The results showed that many people were either buying too much food and wasting it or cooking all their food, but having too many leftovers. I thought about the whole process of buying food and sketched it out. It seemed like awareness about food purchasing while at the store could be a potential direction. </p>

						<figcaption>What does the process of purchasing food look like?</figcaption>
					</figure>


					<p><span class="bold">Narrowing the Focus:</span> Initially I thought it would be helpful to build awareness around the categories of food someone was wasting on a weekly basis, which would help them prevent certain purchases in the store later on. I would tie their thrown-out food to a rough dollar amount. This app would clearly be targeted to someone who sees food waste as dollars going down the drain. In my initial sketches I was asking people to pick 1 of 4 larger food categories, like fruit, veggies, meat or dairy. They would set up a scheduled notification, and later in the week when the notification popped up, they would enter the specific food items by category. For instance, if someone set the notification to ring on Sunday, they would then quickly be prompted to enter what kinds of fruit items they tossed etc.</p>

					<figure class="items span_three_of_three">
						<img class="intro-pic" src="images/sketch2.jpg">
						<figcaption>Initial sketches</figcaption>
					</figure>


					<p>Then I realized entering that level of detail was too complicated for this single feature app. It would be asking a lot of people to record their food waste by item, so then I proceed to sketch screens that would just ask people to enter how many food items by category they threw out instead of the specific items (ex: How fruits did you toss?). Still, it seemed clear that there wasn’t a reward big enough to match the sort of effort required to input that data, even if the interface was simple and straightforward. It was time to narrow even more. Perhaps it was best just to just focus on how many food items, in general, people were throwing out each week.</p>

					<p>The app would simply require people to pick a day during the week to get a prompt. On the prompt day, they would be asked how many food items they tossed. Then they would see either a “congratulations” message if they threw out less than the previous week or be prompted to look at tips if they threw out more. Finally, they would be able to see a visualization of how many items they were throwing out over time.</p>

					<h3>Result</h3>
					<p>I made some sketches of the single feature app and got to coding the prototype in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This would like be an app for a mobile device, but since I was just building an interactive prototype, I coded a web app to test my assumptions. You can see my prototype here: <a class="para-anchors" href="http://geethapai.com/aux_bootcamp_challenge/"> http://geethapai.com/aux_bootcamp_challenge/</a>Note: it might be useful to shrink down the size of your browser to mimick a mobile application.</p>

					<p>Conceptualizing and building my prototype was an exercise of focus and narrowing. The process involved diving deep in one area, and then pulling back to look at the larger picture, and then focusing back to a specific area and narrowing the scope. In terms of the app, I think one area for improvement would be on the incentive for users. If I had more time, I would have spent additional time incorporating some of BJ Fogg’s Purple Path Behavior research into thinking through the app’s users incentive, as well as the overall user ecosystem. All in all, it was so much fun to think through an idea, do user research and design and code the app within a short period of time.</p>
