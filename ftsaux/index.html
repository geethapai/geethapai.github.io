	<div class="statement"><p>My favorite way to celebrate someone in my life is to make them a 3D pop-up card chock full their quirks and interests. I take my insights about who they are and what they love and build something that is meaningful to them. At my core, I’m someone who is endlessly curious about people. My design thinking is informed by this curiosity, as well as a desire to build experiences that transcend differences and create opportunities for people to gather the information they seek, learn something new or accomplish something meaningful.</p> 
	
	<p>Through my years of working in education, I learned how design choices impact learning experiences. I noticed that sites and resources were often times designed in a way that did not consider the user’s needs or perspectives. It is these sorts of user challenges, coupled with my passion for design and human behavior that compelled me to join the Startup Institute’s product and design track, which I recently completed.  During the program, I expanded on my existing HTML and CSS skills and dove into wireframing, card sorting and other UX principles. I want to be part of Fresh Tilled Soil’s apprenticeship program to learn best practices from thought leaders in the UX field, push the boundaries of my skills and creativity with the guidance of Fresh Tilled Soil staff and gain experience working on agency design projects.</p>

				<p>I have an eclectic background that brings together social science and education, and informs my approach to design. I believe my experience gives me a unique perspective on human behavior and how people learn - both central concepts to user experience design.</p>

			<p>Intellectually curious by nature, I’ve taken the initiative to develop cool projects on my own, like building a photo sharing web app in Rails and creating a UX case study of a website I’ve used quite a bit. (Please see my <a href="http://geethapai.prosite.com/">portfolio</a> to review both projects). </p>

			<p>Through my many years of work experience, I developed expertise in strategy development, project management and relationship building. These skills could be beneficial while collaborating with clients and fellow apprentices on projects during the program
