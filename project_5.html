					<h2>UX Redesign: EITC Website</h2>
					<p>For several years I served as a volunteer IRS tax preparer for the Boston’s Earned Income Tax Credit Coalition. The Earned Income Tax Credit is a federal credit that is eligible to people who make below a certain income level. Millions of dollars go unclaimed every year. The coalition ensures that many people who are low-income take advantage of the credit by providing free tax preparation services. In this case study, I reimagined Boston’s EITC website.</p>
					
					<h3>Problem</h3>
					<p>The EITC Coalition’s website (<a class="para-anchors" href="http://www.bostontaxhelp.org/">bostontaxhelp.org</a>) contains a great deal of information, but it could be better organized so users can find the information they need more easily. The current site’s main page contains a lot of information about resources that are not related to the EITC, which can make it difficult to navigate. In addition, important information is scattered and difficult to read.  While the city has attempted to organize information by user type within a side navigation menu, there is also information on the main page that pertains to taxpayers, which cannot be found in the the taxpayer section. In addition, there are multiple links on the main page that pertain to the same information.</p>

					<h3>Process</h3>
					<p>Before diving into any wireframing, I wanted to delve deeper into the people
					who use the site. During my time as an EITC volunteer tax preparer, I learned more about the communities I was working in and witnessed the diversity of community members who avail themselves of free tax prep services. Based on my work in the field, I developed assumptive personas based on 4 main groups who might use the EITC website to seek out information about eligibility, tax prep site locations or volunteering as a tax preparer.</p>

					<h3>Result</h3>
					<p>After thinking through the personas groups and their goals, I knew that it would be important to speak to each of those groups from the home page. My goal was also to clean up the design and make text more legible and easier to read. Furthermore, I wanted to make sure information would be easy to find – so I would use large buttons with information targeted to my four personas. The four main categories would be: </p>
					<ul>
					<li>Taxpayer Info: This page contains Earned Income Tax Credit eligibility requirements and a list of materials that taxpayers should bring to tax sites.</li>

					<li>Free Tax Prep section: Simple page with a search function and a list of the tax prep sites in Boston. </li>

					<li>Additional Resources: Contains other financial resources that do not directly pertain to EITC but are important services. </li>

					<li>Volunteer Info: The EITC volunteer program is run by another Boston-area nonprofit, so this link would take the user directly to that site. </li> 
					</ul>

					<p>Below are the resulting wireframes with annotations.</p>
