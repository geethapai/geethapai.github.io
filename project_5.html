						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>As part of a UX bootcamp, I designed and coded an a highly-focused, single feature application - from UX strategy, to user research to code - in just 2 weeks. I decided to focus on the problem that I and many of my peers face: throwing out food. The goal was to create a functional prototype, with a focus on functionality rather than visual design. The challenge here would be to go from a broad set of problems to building a focused product/prototype.</p>


						<h3>Process</h3>
						<ul>
						<li>I first dove into research about the issue of food waste to understand the main challenges that people encounter and why they throw out food. Also I learned about who may be more likely to throw out food and who might actually care about this problem.</li>
						<li>Conducted observations about food waste in the home by observing my friends throwing out food. (They thought I was observing food storing not food tossing!) I also sent out surveys to find out why people throw out food and under what circumstances.</li>
						<li>Initially I thought the issue might partly be around food expiration dates. The user survey and research results showed that many people were either buying too much food and wasting it or cooking all their food, but having too many leftovers that they had to toss. I thought about the whole process of buying food and sketched it out. It seemed like awareness about food purchasing while at the store could be a potential direction.</li>
						<li>I continued to refine the app. The focus continued to shift from what food you toss...to how much you actually toss. The reason for the shift: it takes way too much effort for users to enter each item they toss. Focusing on the number of items would be easier for users. The app is solely meant to bring awareness to people for a couple weeks so they can then adjust their behavior over time and build awareness before they go grocery shopping.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Result</h3>
						<p>I made some sketches of the single feature app and got to coding the prototype in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This would like be an app for a mobile device, but since I was just building an interactive prototype, I coded a web app to test my assumptions. You can click on the prototype button below. Just resize your browser to mimic using the app on a mobile device.</p>

							<h3>Reasons Why People Throw Out Food</h3>

			        <p>Through the user surveys I learned that the main reason people were throwing out food is because they buy too much, which they don't end up using or they cooked all their food, but had more leftovers than they could eat. It became clear that I should look at building awareness about food waste before grocery shopping happens. Below is a sketch I did of the grocery shopping process.</p>

		        <h3>Final App Screens</h3>
		        <p>Initially, I thought it would be more helpful for users to see exactly what they were throwing away each week, so they could plan for the next grocery trip and hopefully buy less food. As I sketched I realized that would be way to much work for the user to enter everything they were tossing out. (I also showed my paper prototypes to potential users felt the same way.) Instead I decided to focus simply on the helping users enter the number of items they tossed per week. This would at least build a baseline awareness for people about their food waste. Users will get positive or helpful feedback depending on how they do compared to previous weeks.
